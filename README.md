Code for: Market Anomalies during Geopolitical and Geoeconomic Conflict: Evidence from Russia

Due to the limitation of the dissertation upload section, this Github page will have all the necessary files required to run my code successfully, so please download the Excel file as well as all the CSV files before running the code

Notes about the code:
1. Change you filepath as necessary: I recommend using your desktop folder
2. I have uploaded two versions of the code: 1) DISSFINAL777 will have the code after running all the steps with the output cells, 2) DISSFINAL_Kernel_cleared has all the output cells cleared
3. Finally, due to the API being a $99 per month feature from Twelvedata.com (required to import MOEX equities), I have not featured the data collection code as my membership has expired due to the fact that the University of Bath does not have an API budget for students, and I can't keep paying the subscription fee.
